# Basic CRUD Operations App using Express and Mongoose with error handling 

Basically this is a simple app that implements full CRUD with forms where we can create new products, update products, delete products, show/ list all the products and also filter them on the basis of category using Mongoose the ODM(Object Document Mapper) of MongoDB. 

##

We start with integrating Mongoose with Express. We listen to the http://localhost:8080/ port. Next, we create our model of the application in a separate file product.js defining the product schema. The schema defines our product has a name which is of type String and it is required, then price which is of type Number and also required and finally a category, we delcare an enum to specify the category option to be fruit, vegetables or dairy. Then, we compile our model and export it from product.js. We create a seeds.js file to populate the database with some initial data. 

##

Next, we specify our index route that is going to result in a query to our Mongo database. To show all products we use Product.find({}), it will take time, hence we use async-await promise. we follow this pattern, an async callback for a route, in this project. Following the route will respond with a templete built using EJS a templating language to generate HTML markup for the route. We groups all out templates in views directory.

The next route is to view details about a single product, it will render us the show.ejs template. We make all the products as a link in the index page so that clicking the individual product will follow the details page of the product with the product id generated by MongoDB. We specify the route with the product id. 

Next, we implemented add new product route. We need a form and we need a route that we submi the form to, so basically we need two routes. Get request to the products/new routhe will serve the form and a Post request to the products is where we submit the form and actually create a new product. So the get request will render new.ejs the templating page shown in the third image of the screenshots of the project. When we have a post request and we want information from the post request body, we don't have access to the request body immediately. We need to tell Express to use the middlewear urlencoded.

If we click on a specific product like Chocolate Whole Milk in this case, we will be directed to the details page of that product.

Finally we can see the new product is added to the all product list.
